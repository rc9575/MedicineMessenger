## PostScribe

# Details
The idea of a simple pill reminder app is boring- we wanted our application to do more. While our application sends reminder to patients in different increments (depending on the prescription written), it also collects data from responses the patients send us. This data can be used in a variety of ways, from predicting pill adherence to gauging new premium costs for health insurance.

# What we used
Built with '''Twilio''' and '''Flask''' for Hack@Brown 2018.
